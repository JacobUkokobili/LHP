# Lagos Home Price Prediction
Data science project focused on estimating home prices in Lagos State.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyse and predict the generated data of home listings in order to find relevant insights, patterns and any kind of information that could be useful to determine business decisions.

## Data source
The data used for this project was scraped from [Nigeria Property Centre](https://nigeriapropertycentre.com/)

## Metric of Evaluation
The model was evaluated on Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) of the predicted value and the observed sales price

## Feedback
